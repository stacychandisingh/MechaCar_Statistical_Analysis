## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![1](resources/image1.PNG?raw=true "Title")

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![3](resources/image3.PNG?raw=true "Title")

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Based on the image of the t-tests above, it can be determined using the p-values and an assumed common significance level of 0.05 percent that:
1. All manufacturing lots are statistically different from the population mean of 1500 pounds per square inch. The p-value of this dataset is: 0.03.
2. Lots 1 and 2 are not statistically different from the population mean of 1500 pounds per square inch. Lot 1's p-value is: 1 while Lot 2's p-value is: 0.61.
3. Lot 3 is statistically different from the population mean of 1500 pounds per square inch. Lot 3's p-value is 0.04.
